Anima Tools Changes
===================

0.1.0.a1
--------

* Update: Organized the folder structure
* Update: Moved all rigging scripts to ``rig`` package.
* New: Created a new package called ``pipeline``.
* Update: Converted the uiCompiler.py to a standalone script which runs with
  system python (where it is much easier to install PySide and PyQt4 with
  system package managers).
