      column in tasks_treeWidget.

0.1.0.a3
========

* **Pipeline:**

  * **UI:**

    * **Fix:** Reorganized and fixed the code that chooses between ``PySide``
      or ``PyQt4``. To choose one of the libraries, let say to choose
      ``PySide`` as the library in UI::

        # first import the code that sets the system to pyside
        from anima.pipeline.ui import SET_PYSIDE
        SET_PYSIDE()

        # then import QtCore and QtGui as follows
        from anima.pipeline.ui.lib import QtCore, QtGui

      The default library is PyQt4.
    * **Update:** **version_creator.fill_tasks_treeWidget()** now works much
      faster.
    * **Update:** **version_creator.previous_versions_tableWidget** now
      displays the icon of the created environment.

  * **Environments:**

    * **Maya:**

      * **Update:** Maya now uses the folder that the current version is saved
        as the project folder.
      * **Update:** Maya sets the fps and resolution even if it is not the
        first version in its series.

    user to restore the previous version from the given path.
  * **New:** Created environment class for **Fusion**.
  * **New:** Created environment class for **Maya**.
